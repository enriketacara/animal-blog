# Animal-Blog
Developed a responsive Animal Blog website using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
Fetched animal data from an external API using the Fetch API and displayed the content dynamically in styled cards.
The project demonstrates clean API integration and a structured layout to present animal information in an engaging way.
